# TASK-8-SPEED-CONTROL-OF-DC-MOTOR
In this task, I first stimulated the circuit in Tinkercad and later performed it in marvel lab.
The circuit consists of Arduino board, Motor driver , Breadboard, Motor, Battery and a potentiometer. The code was uploaded to to the Arduino board using Arduino IDE and the speed of the motor was controlled using the potentiometer.
